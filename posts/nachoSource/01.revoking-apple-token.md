In the past few weeks, an issue has been causing some headaches amongst the mobile developers community. By the end of May, [Apple has announced](https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=12m75xbj) that every new version of apps published in App Store that allow users to sign in through Apple IDs also must allow them to cancel their subscription through the use of a [specific API](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/sign_in_with_apple/revoke_tokens). The app versions that don't implement this requirement will neither pass the review nor be available for use.

So far this seems pretty legit. The problem is that the documentation provided is, at least, insufficient when not confusing, and the official deadline for this was on June 30th. This pushed the whole community to develop different workarounds in order to meet this deadline.

In this post I am sharing a solution that gathers conclusions extracted from the work of many developers.

> _Disclaimer_
> ❗Part of the problem is that the use of this API does not guarantee the effective disassociation between your app and the Apple ID -which is logically the pursued objective, even when it returns _200_ (and no other significant info). Leaving that aside, this workaround does the job as it satisfies the required behavior. The rest is Apple’s problem.

2. Generating the `clientSecret`
3. Consuming the API
4. Conclusion

### 1. Saving the credential token

Although I am using [_React Native_](https://reactnative.dev), this solution should work globally if you can access the `identityToken` every time the user enters the app, either signing or logging in.
> This value has an expiration time of one day, and it also shows some user info that you can see through [_this tool_](https://jwt.io).

```javascript
import auth from "@react-native-firebase/auth";
import { appleAuth } from "@invertase/react-native-apple-authentication";

const signIn = async ({ saveIdToken }) => {

// Start the sign-in request
const appleAuthRequestResponse = await appleAuth.performRequest({
      requestedOperation: appleAuth.Operation.LOGIN, // 1
      requestedScopes: [
         appleAuth.Scope.EMAIL, // 0
         appleAuth.Scope.FULL_NAME // 1
      ]
  });

  // Create a Firebase credential from the response
  const { identityToken, nonce } = appleAuthRequestResponse;

  const appleCredential = auth.AppleAuthProvider.credential(
      identityToken,
      nonce
  );

  // Save this value
  saveIdToken(identityToken);

  // Complete the signIn
  auth().signInWithCredential(appleCredential)
};

export { signIn };
```

> Initially, my intention was to use the single-use `authorizationCode` provided by the sign-in response. The issue here was that this code had an expiration of only 5 minutes and it also needed an extra step before revoking the token. Anyway, I am going to add it in case you want to use it instead of _identityToken_.

### 2. Generating the `clientSecret`

> The following steps are executed in your server, so in this case we are using [_Node.js_](https://nodejs.org/en/)

The second JWT that we need is the `clientSecret`, which can be generated using a [_series of keys_](https://github.com/jooyoungho/apple-token-revoke-in-firebase/issues/1#issuecomment-1163098500) associated with your app.

```javascript
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');
const { readFile } = require('fs/promises');

const makeJWT = async () => {
  const privateKey = await readFile("AuthKey_***.p8");

  return jwt.sign(
    {
      iss: YOUR_TEAM_ID,
      iat: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000),
      exp: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) + 120,
      aud: "https://appleid.apple.com",
      sub: com.***.app,
    },
    privateKey,
    {
      algorithm: "ES256",
      header: {
        alg: "ES256",
        kid: YOUR_KEY_ID,
      },
    }
  );
};
```

## 3. Consuming the API

At last, calling this API returns a _200_ code if the previous steps were fine. If not, the response will be a _400_ (bad request) with some info.

```javascript
const fetch = require('node-fetch');

const revokeToken = (identityToken) => {
    const clientSecret = makeJWT();

    return fetch('https://appleid.apple.com/auth/revoke', {
        method: "POST",
        body: JSON.stringify({
            client_id: YOUR_CLIENT_ID,
            client_secret: clientSecret,
            token: identityToken,
        }),
        headers: { "Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" },
    });
};
```

In case you want or need the use of `authorizationCode`, you should add an extra step in order to get the `refreshToken`:

```javascript
const revokeToken = async (authorizationCode) => {
    const fetch = require("node-fetch");

    const clientSecret = makeJWT();

    const authTokenResponse = await fetch(
        "https://appleid.apple.com/auth/token",
        {
            method: "POST",
            body: JSON.stringify({
                client_id: parameter.clientId,
                client_secret: clientSecret,
                code: authorizationCode,
                grant_type: "authorization_code",
            }),
            headers: { "Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" },
        }
    );

    return await fetch("https://appleid.apple.com/auth/revoke", {
        method: "POST",
        body: JSON.stringify({
            client_id: parameter.clientId,
            client_secret: clientSecret,
            token: authTokenResponse.data.refresh_token,
            token_type_hint: "refresh_token",
        }),
        headers: { "Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" },
    });
}
```

### 4. Conclusion

This workaround aims to be a shortcut that allows you get around this problem for the moment, but the obvious thing is that we are all waiting for a stronger solution proposed by Apple that actually completes this work.
