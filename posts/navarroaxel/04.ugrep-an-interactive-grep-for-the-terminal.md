The `ugrep` tool is a faster, user-friendly and compatible `grep` replacement written in C++11. Let's check how to install `ugrep` and how to use the interactive query mode, fuzzy search, and other options.

## What is `grep`?

If you are a terminal user, `grep` is a basic tool that you must learn. The `grep` command is a filter that prints lines from a file that contain a match for one or more patterns.

E.g. `grep` can help you to find specific output in a log file like the following:

```bash
grep 10.0.0.1 server.log
```

But, we're going to focus in the `ugrep` app.

## Installation

In Windows, you can just download the full-featured [ugrep.exe](https://github.com/Genivia/ugrep/releases) from the [official repository](https://github.com/Genivia/ugrep), or use a tool like: `choco install ugrep` or `scoop install ugrep`.

In MacOS, you could use `brew install ugrep`.

Or, find your destiny here: <https://github.com/Genivia/ugrep#install>.

## The basics

The basic usage is start the interactive query mode and look for a specific text in recursively in sub-directories using plain-text or regex.

```bash
ugrep -Q
```

üí° Tip: you can add the `--ignore-case` argument to make case-insensitive matches.

If you want to see only the files that contains the search term you can use the following arguments:

```bash
ugrep -Q --ignore-case --files-with-matches
```

## The fuzzy search

The [fuzzy search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approximate_string_matching) is the technique of look for a text that match a pattern approximately, instead of exactly. We can look for a text within the specified [Levenshtein distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance).

```bash
ugrep -Z3 android
```

üí° Tip: `-Z3` matches up to three extra, missing or replaced characters; `-Z+~3` allows up to three insertions (`+`) or substitutions (`~`), but no deletions (`-`).

You can start a query mode with fuzzy search like the following:

```bash
ugrep -Q -Z3
```

## Interactive TUI

Once you started the query mode, you can toggle fuzzy search, list only filenames, or more in options panel pressing `F1`.

Press the upper case Z to toggle on/off the fuzzy search mode, and `[` to increase and `]` to decrease the fuzziness.

Also, you can scroll the result of a search using the arrow keys or `^S`, then with `F2` you can open the editor for the file of the current matched text (nano, vim, etc).

## More ugrep

You have a lot of possible customization options you could investigate in the [README](https://github.com/Genivia/ugrep#readme) or use [ugrep with Vim](https://github.com/Genivia/ugrep#vim).
