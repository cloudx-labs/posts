We can use a well-known URL in our websites to make our _change password_ forms discoverable by tools, like 1Password, LastPass, Bitwarden, etc.

For `https://example.com`, this magic URL would be `https://example.com/.well-known/change-password`.

Let's check how this works. ðŸ’ª

## A well-known URL

What is a [well-known URI](https://ldapwiki.com/wiki/Well-Known%20URIs)? It's basically a group of predefined "links" inside a `/.well-known/` directory of a website.

These links can be either a HTTP redirect, like the change-password URI, or a document with a specific format, like the "well known" OpenID Connect configuration in JSON format located at `/.well-known/openid-configuration`. We can find an example here <https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/v2.0/.well-known/openid-configuration>.

## Just a redirect

The [specification](https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-change-password-url/) for Well-Known URLs for Change passwords are still in draft, but we can found examples in popular websites like [GitHub](https://github.com/.well-known/change-password), [Slack](https://slack.com/.well-known/change-password), or [Wikipedia](https://wikipedia.org/.well-known/change-password).

ðŸ’¡ If you can't find the reset password link in a website, you can use this Well-Known URL.

## Conclusion

We can programmatically advertise where a user can change its password, improving the **security** and **usability** of a website that requires authentication.

Now you can create a semantic HTML form for change passwords and the password manager tool will make the rest.
